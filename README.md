# Coalition_Race
The project is a C++ program that simulates a Coalition Race and report the first coalition formed (or failure).

The objective of this project is to design an object-oriented system and gain
implementation experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures, and unique
C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”. I learned also how to handle memory in C++ and avoid
memory leaks.
